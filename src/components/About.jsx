          My journey into full stack development began in March 2024 when I
          joined Uplift Code Camp. This experience sparked my enthusiasm for
          coding and set me on a path of discovery and growth. Since then, I’ve
          dived into numerous personal projects, developing a range of
          applications and honing my skills with each new challenge. I’m
          dedicated to learning and evolving, constantly exploring new
          technologies and methodologies to stay ahead in the ever-changing tech
          landscape.

          Outside of coding, you’ll find me enjoying my favorite Netflix movies
          and series, hitting the basketball court, or embracing the thrill of
          snowboarding. Balancing my professional journey with these personal
          interests keeps me inspired and energized.
